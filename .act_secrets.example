# ACT Secrets Configuration
# Copy this file to .act_secrets and add your actual secret values
# DO NOT commit .act_secrets to version control!

# GitHub token for API access (required for sync-template-files workflow)
# Generate a personal access token with repo permissions
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Additional secrets that might be needed by workflows
# Add more secrets as needed for your specific workflows

# ACT runtime variables used by some GitHub Action steps (eg. actions/upload-artifact)
# When running workflows locally with `act`, some actions expect these to be present.
# You can use placeholder values for local testing. `setup-act` copies this file to
# `.act_secrets` so they'll be available to the containerized runner.
# Note: the real GitHub Actions runner injects a dynamic token/URL; for local runs
# a stable dummy token and a local URL are usually sufficient.
ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN=local-runtime-token
# Example URL for the artifact server. If you use `--artifact-server-path` with act
# the server will be created locally; adjust the host/port if you run a custom server.
ACTIONS_RUNTIME_URL=http://localhost:8080
